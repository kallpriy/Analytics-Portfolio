# Business Assumptions & Metric Definitions  
*SaaS Subscription Revenue & Cohort Intelligence*

This document explains the business logic, assumptions, and metric definitions used in this project so that non-technical stakeholders and recruiters can clearly understand how insights were derived.

---

## 1. Business Context

The project simulates a **B2B SaaS subscription business** where customers subscribe to recurring plans (monthly or annual).  
The objective is to evaluate **revenue quality, customer retention, churn behavior, and customer lifetime value**, not just topline revenue.

---

## 2. Key Assumptions

- Each customer can have **one active subscription at a time**
- Revenue is recognized from **invoices**, not from subscription start dates
- Churn occurs only when a subscription is **explicitly cancelled**
- Customers with `NULL end_date` are considered **active**
- Product usage events act as a proxy for **customer engagement**
- Analysis is performed at a **monthly granularity**

These assumptions align with standard SaaS analytics practices.

---

## 3. Metric Definitions

### 3.1 Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

**Definition:**  
Total recurring revenue generated from active subscriptions in a given month.

**How it is calculated:**  
Sum of invoice amounts grouped by invoice month.

**Why it matters:**  
MRR shows predictable revenue growth and is the primary KPI for SaaS businesses.

---

### 3.2 Revenue Breakdown (New, Expansion, Contraction)

**New Revenue**  
Revenue from customers generating revenue for the first time.

**Expansion Revenue**  
Additional revenue from existing customers (upgrades, add-ons, increased usage).

**Contraction Revenue**  
Revenue lost due to downgrades or partial churn from existing customers.

**Why it matters:**  
Helps distinguish **healthy growth** (expansion-led) from growth driven purely by acquisition.

---

## 3.3 Churn Rate

**Definition:**  
Percentage of customers who cancelled during a given month.

**Formula:** 
Churn Rate = Churned Customers / Active Customers at Start of Month

**Important Note:**  
Active customer base is calculated as a **point-in-time snapshot**, not new signups.

**Why it matters:**  
Churn directly impacts long-term revenue sustainability.

---

## 3.4 Cohort Retention

**Definition:**  
Measures how long customers continue to stay active after signup.

**Cohort:**  
Customers grouped by their **signup month**.

**Month Index:**  
- Month 0 → Signup month  
- Month 1 → One month after signup  
- Month 2 → Two months after signup  

**Retention Formula:**  
Retention % = Active Customers in Month N / Total Customers in Cohort

**Why month index is used:**  
Calendar months can distort retention. Month index ensures apples-to-apples comparison across cohorts.

---

## 3.5 Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Definition:**  
Total revenue generated by a customer over their entire relationship with the company.

**Calculation:**  
Sum of all invoice amounts per customer.

**Why it matters:**  
Helps identify high-value customers and revenue concentration risk.

---

## 3.6 Usage vs Churn

**Definition:**  
Compares product usage frequency between active and churned customers.

**Assumption:**  
Lower product usage indicates weaker engagement and higher churn risk.

**Why it matters:**  
Usage is a **leading indicator** of churn and can guide proactive retention efforts.

---

## 3.7 High-Risk Customers

**Definition:**  
Active customers with:
- Very low product usage
- Below-average lifetime value

**Why it matters:**  
These customers are candidates for:
- Customer success outreach
- Product education
- Targeted engagement campaigns

---

## 4. Analytical Design Principles

- **SQL handles business logic** (cohorts, churn math, revenue decomposition)
- **Tableau handles visualization only**
- No joins or metric logic inside Tableau
- Each dashboard answers **one clear business question**

This separation ensures accuracy, scalability, and explainability.

---

## 5. Intended Business Use

The dashboards can support:
- Executive revenue reviews
- Retention strategy planning
- Customer success prioritization
- Product engagement analysis

---

## 6. Limitations

- Data is simulated and does not represent a specific real company
- No seasonality adjustments applied
- No predictive churn modeling (descriptive analytics only)

---

## 7. Summary

This project focuses on **how SaaS businesses actually evaluate growth and retention**, emphasizing correctness, clarity, and decision relevance over cosmetic visualization.
