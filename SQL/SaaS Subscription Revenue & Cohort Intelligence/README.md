## 📈 Key Analytics

## 💡 Key Insights  
- Growth mainly comes from **existing customers spending more**, not just new signups.  
- Churn is steady, meaning growth isn’t hiding retention problems.  
- Retention drops fast in the first 3 months → onboarding is critical.  
- Low product usage strongly predicts higher churn.  
- A small group of customers drives most of the revenue → risk of over-reliance.  
- Newer cohorts show better early retention → improved onboarding and product maturity.
